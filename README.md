# Godot Tower Defense Tutorial (3D)

This repository contains the source code for the Godot Tower Defense Tutorial (3D) series.

[You can follow along with the series on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXkkNSfxLRI&list=PLpwc3ughKbZexDyPexHN2MXLliKAovkpl&index=2&t=2s)

This series uses assets that were originally created by Brackeys for his tower defense tutorial in Unity. 
That was the first full-length game dev tutorial I ever watched, so I created this series in Godot out of appreciation for his work.
Thanks Brackeys!
